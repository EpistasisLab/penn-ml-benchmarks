description: >
  Data from a vineyard on a small island in Lake Erie.
  Dataset from Smoothing Methods in Statistics (p. 146-147). Dead link: stat.cmu.edu/datasets.
  The vineyard is divided into 52 rows, and the 52 observations in the data set correspond to the sum of the yields of the harvests in 
  1989, 1990, and 1991 separated by row, as measured by the total number of lugs.
  A lug is a basket that is used to carry the harvested grapes, which holds roughly 30 pounds of grapes). 
  The row numbers are naturally ordered, with increasing row number reflecting movement from northwest to southeast.
