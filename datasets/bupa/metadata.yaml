Description of current target: >
  Train/test selector.
  The classification of either 1 or 2 was used by BUPA researchers to decide what data should go in train vs in test.
  This feature is NOT whether the individual had a liver condition.
  The dataset does not contain ANY features determining presence or absence of a liver condition.
  The Drinks feature is designed to be the dependent variable of this dataset.
Remove TODO, this line, and everything in between, when dataset has been changed.
