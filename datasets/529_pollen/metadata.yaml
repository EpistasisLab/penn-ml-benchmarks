description: >
  Synthetic pollen dataset generated by David Coleman at RCA Laboratories in Princeton.
  Details on the simulation of these "ellipsoidal voids" can be found in the openml source page.
  Although the underlaying distribution is Gaussian, the data has been scaled, rotated and translated.
  Variable names are ficticious.
