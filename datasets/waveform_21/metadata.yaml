dataset: waveform_21
description: >
  Three classes of waves, twenty one attributes.
  Each class is generated from a combination of 2 of 3 "base" waves with added noise.
  All attributes include noise.
  The column names from source are similar to those found in pmlb, except they start with X, are all two digits, and
  begin indexing at 0 instead of at 1. The 'target' feature in pmlb is equivalent to 'V22'.
