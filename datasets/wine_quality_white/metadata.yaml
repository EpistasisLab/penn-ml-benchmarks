dataset: wine_quality_white
description: >
  The dataset is related to the white variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
  For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference (Cortez et al., 2009).
  Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
  The inputs include objective tests (e.g. pH values) and the output is sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts).
