    Title of Database: E. coli promoter gene sequences (DNA)
                      with associated imperfect domain theory
    Past Usage:
       (a) biological:
           -- Harley, C. and Reynolds, R. 1987.
              "Analysis of E. Coli Promoter Sequences."
              Nucleic Acids Research, 15:2343-2361.
           machine learning:
           -- Towell, G., Shavlik, J. and Noordewier, M. 1990.
              "Refinement of Approximate Domain Theories by Knowledge-Based
              Artificial Neural Networks." In Proceedings of the Eighth National
              Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-90).
       (b) attributes predicted: member/non-member of class of sequences with
           biological promoter activity (promoters initiate the process of gene
           expression).
       (c) Results of study indicated that machine learning techniques (neural
           networks, nearest neighbor, contributors' KBANN system) performed as
           well/better than classification based on canonical pattern matching
           (method used in biological literature).

    Relevant Information Paragraph:
       This dataset has been developed to help evaluate a "hybrid" learning
       algorithm ("KBANN") that uses examples to inductively refine preexisting
       knowledge.  Using a "leave-one-out" methodology, the following errors
       were produced by various ML algorithms.  (See Towell, Shavlik, &
       Noordewier, 1990, for details.)

    Type of domain: non-numeric, nominal (one of A, G, T, C)
       -- Note: DNA nucleotides can be grouped into a hierarchy, as shown below:

                  X (any)
                /   \
          (purine) R     Y (pyrimidine)

    Number of Instances: 106

    Number of Attributes: 59
       -- class (positive or negative)

                 1   One of {+/-}, indicating the class ("+" = promoter).
                 2   The instance name (non-promoters named by position in the
                     1500-long nucleotide sequence provided by T. Record).
              3-59   The remaining 57 fields are the sequence, starting at
                     position -50 (p-50) and ending at position +7 (p7). Each of
                     these fields is filled by one of {a, g, t, c}.
                     Code: a=0; c=1; g=2; t=3.
