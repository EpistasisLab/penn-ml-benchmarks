# Benchmark data sets

This directory contains over 120 data sets for benchmarking supervised machine learning algorithms.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a separate data set, and will have a README file providing some basic information about the data set.

# High-level summary of data sets

These regression benchmarks are selected from [OpenML](https://www.openml.org). The `did` column in the [meta-features table](/datasets/regression/Regression_datasets_pmlb.tsv) presents the dataset ID in OpenML.
