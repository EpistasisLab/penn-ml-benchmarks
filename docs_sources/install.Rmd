Most users should install PMLB from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using `pip`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ pip install pmlb
```

For access to new features or datasets that are not yet merged into an official release, you can instead install from [the GitHub sources](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/penn-ml-benchmarks):

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git clone https://github.com/EpistasisLab/penn-ml-benchmarks
$ cd penn-ml-benchamrks/
$ pip install .
```
